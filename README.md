  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "event": "UserCreated", "userId": 123 }'
```

### üì§ Example: Simulate webhook to external URL

Trigger a webhook from this app to another service: 
```
POST /simulateWebhook
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://webhook.site/your-id",
  "payload": {
    "type": "InvoiceGenerated",
    "amount": 199.99
  }
}
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

```json
{
  "WebhookLogStorage": {
    "LogFilePath": "logs.txt"
  }
}
```
